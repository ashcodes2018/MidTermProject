Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named David and his trusty band of students.
The ninja monkeys were slightly less immortal.
But the monkeys were not just ordinary monkeys, they were ninja monkeys.
Are these monkeys friendly? 
Only to that Kai Yun dude. 
Trying to stop the evil Willy Wonka from taking over the world.
I don't know what this story is about, i'm gonna say something japanese?
Does anyone actually know Japanese?
