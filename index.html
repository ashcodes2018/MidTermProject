Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of ninja monkeys.
The ninja monkeys were slightly less immortal.
But the monkeys were not just ordinary monkeys, they were ninja monkeys.
Trying to stop the evil Willy Wonka from taking over the world.
Are these monkeys friendly?
I don't know what this story is about, i'm gonna say something japanese?
Does anyone actually know Japanese?
