Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of ninja monkeys.
The ninja monkeys were slightly less immortal.
But the monkeys were not just ordinary monkeys, they were ninja monkeys.
I don't know what this story is about, i'm gonna say something japanese?
